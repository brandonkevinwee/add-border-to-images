# Add Border to Images

Adds a 2px black border to all images within the same directory as the deployed JAR file.

Acceptable file types are defined in ModifyImage.getImageFilesFromCurrentDirectory(). The currently accepted file types are png, jpg, and jpeg.

Program was created because Evernote can't add borders to images and I got tired of using paint.
